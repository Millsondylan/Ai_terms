        <p>
          By using InsightFlowAI‚Äôs AI Coach and AI Insights, you agree to these AI Terms. They are
          designed to protect users, clarify AI limitations, and promote safe, responsible use.
        </p>

        <h2>1) Acceptance & Scope</h2>
        <p>
          These AI Terms govern your use of AI‚Äëpowered features in the InsightFlowAI app and website,
          including chat coaching, automated analyses, and recommendations (‚ÄúAI Features‚Äù). By enabling
          or interacting with AI Features, you agree to these AI Terms in addition to our general Terms
          of Service and Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2) No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>
          AI outputs are generated content and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or out‚Äëof‚Äëdate. They do
          not constitute financial, investment, legal, medical, or other professional advice. You are
          solely responsible for any decisions or actions taken based on AI outputs, including trades
          and portfolio changes.
        </p>

        <h2>3) Risk Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Trading involves risk of loss. Past performance (including simulated results) is not
          indicative of future results. Use AI outputs as educational inputs only and always apply your
          independent judgment.
        </p>

        <h2>4) Data & Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We may store your chats, prompts, and AI outputs to provide context and history across sessions.</li>
          <li>We may process anonymized, aggregated usage metrics to improve quality and reliability.</li>
          <li>Do not share sensitive personal data (e.g., government IDs, full payment details, passwords).</li>
          <li>We honor applicable deletion requests, subject to backup and legal retention requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Model Providers & Routing</h2>
        <p>
          InsightFlowAI may route requests to one or more third‚Äëparty model providers to maintain
          availability and quality (e.g., LongCat AI and other OpenAI‚Äëcompatible providers). Provider
          selection can change over time. You agree that your prompts and necessary context may be sent
          to these providers for processing in accordance with their policies.
        </p>

        <h2>6) Hidden Reasoning (‚ÄúThinking‚Äù)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>By default, AI ‚Äúthinking‚Äù or internal reasoning is hidden in the app‚Äôs UI.</li>
          <li>Users may optionally reveal hidden reasoning via a manual ‚ÄúShow thinking‚Äù toggle.</li>
          <li>Hidden reasoning may be verbose, incomplete, or speculative; treat it as draft analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Safety & Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No attempts to generate or distribute harmful, illegal, or abusive content.</li>
          <li>No attempts to exfiltrate secrets, exploit systems, or misrepresent AI outputs as factual.</li>
          <li>No sharing of others‚Äô private information without consent.</li>
          <li>No automated scraping or rate‚Äëabusive usage of AI endpoints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Quotas, Fair Use & Rate Limits</h2>
        <p>
          AI usage may be subject to per‚Äëplan quotas and rate limits. We may throttle or restrict
          access to preserve system stability. Third‚Äëparty providers may enforce their own limits.
        </p>

        <h2>9) Content Ownership & License</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of your prompts and content you submit. You grant InsightFlowAI a
          license to process, store, display, and analyze that content to provide AI Features and
          improve the service. AI outputs may be similar to content generated for others.
        </p>

        <h2>10) Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          AI Features are intended for users age 18+ or the age of majority in your jurisdiction.
          Do not allow minors to use AI Features unsupervised.
        </p>

        <h2>11) Security</h2>
        <p>
          We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No system is
          perfectly secure; do not submit secrets or credentials in chat.
        </p>

        <h2>12) Changes to AI Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these AI Terms over time. Material changes will be posted at this page with a
          revised date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
