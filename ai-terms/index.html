        <p>
          By using InsightFlowAI‚Äôs AI Coach and AI Insights, you agree to these AI Terms. They are
          designed to protect users, clarify AI limitations, and promote safe, responsible use.
        </p>

        <h2>1) Acceptance & Scope</h2>
        <p>
          These AI Terms govern your use of AI‚Äëpowered features in the InsightFlowAI app and website,
          including chat coaching, automated analyses, and recommendations (‚ÄúAI Features‚Äù). By enabling
          or interacting with AI Features, you agree to these AI Terms in addition to our general Terms
          of Service and Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2) No Professional Advice & Complete Liability Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          AI outputs are generated content and may be inaccurate, incomplete, out‚Äëof‚Äëdate, or entirely
          fabricated. They do not constitute financial, investment, legal, medical, psychological, or
          other professional advice of any kind. The AI is not a qualified professional and cannot
          provide expert guidance or recommendations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete Liability Waiver:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that InsightFlowAI,
          its owners, employees, contractors, and affiliates bear absolutely no liability for any
          consequences, damages, losses, or harm arising from your use of AI Features, including but
          not limited to financial losses, emotional distress, business decisions, or any other
          outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We make no warranties, guarantees, or representations about
          the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or usefulness of AI outputs. All AI responses should
          be treated as speculative suggestions only.</li>
          <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely and completely responsible for any
          decisions or actions taken based on AI outputs, including trades, portfolio changes,
          business decisions, or personal choices. You must apply your own independent judgment and
          seek qualified professional advice when appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Risk Disclosure & Financial Warnings</h2>
        <p>
          Trading and investing involve substantial risk of financial loss. Past performance (including
          simulated, backtested, or hypothetical results) is not indicative of future results. Markets
          can be volatile and unpredictable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Total Loss Possible:</strong> You could lose your entire investment or more through
          trading activities. Leveraged trading increases risk exponentially.</li>
          <li><strong>No Investment Advice:</strong> AI outputs are not investment recommendations or
          financial advice. They are computational suggestions that may be completely wrong or
          inappropriate for your situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Independent Verification:</strong> Always verify AI suggestions against multiple
          independent sources before taking any financial action. Consider consulting licensed financial
          advisors, accountants, or attorneys.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Risks:</strong> AI cannot predict market crashes, black swan events,
          geopolitical crises, or other unforeseen circumstances that may cause severe losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Data Collection, Storage & Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Information You Provide:</strong> When you interact with AI Features, you must provide
          input data, prompts, and context for the AI to function properly. This is an inherent requirement
          of AI systems - they cannot operate without user input. We are not liable for any information,
          data, or content that you choose to include in your prompts or interactions with the AI.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Liability for User Input:</strong> You are solely responsible for the content,
          accuracy, and appropriateness of all information you provide to the AI. We are not liable for
          any consequences, damages, or issues arising from the information contained in your inputs,
          regardless of whether such information is personal, sensitive, confidential, or otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> We may store your chats, prompts, AI responses, and interaction
          history to provide continuity, context, and improved user experience across sessions. This
          storage is necessary for the AI to maintain conversation context and provide relevant responses.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Privacy & Non-Sharing:</strong> Your personal data, conversations, and AI
          interactions are never shared with third parties for marketing, advertising, or any commercial
          purposes. We do not sell, rent, or distribute your personal information. Data is only used
          internally to provide and improve our services.</li>
          <li><strong>Anonymized Analytics:</strong> We may process anonymized, aggregated usage metrics
          and patterns to improve AI quality, reliability, and system performance. This anonymized data
          cannot be traced back to individual users.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensitive Data Warning:</strong> Do not include sensitive personal information such as
          government IDs, complete financial account details, passwords, medical records, or confidential
          business information in your AI interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Retention & Deletion:</strong> We retain data as necessary to provide service
          continuity and comply with legal obligations. We honor applicable data deletion requests,
          subject to backup retention requirements and legal hold policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> All stored data is protected using industry-standard encryption
          and security measures. However, no digital system is completely immune to security risks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) AI Model Limitations & Technical Constraints</h2>
        <p>
          AI systems have inherent technical limitations that users must understand and accept:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> AI models can generate false, fabricated, or nonsensical
          information ("hallucinations"). Always verify AI outputs against reliable sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Context Limitations:</strong> AI has limited context windows and may not remember
          all previous conversation details or maintain perfect consistency across long conversations.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias & Fairness:</strong> AI models may exhibit biases based on their training data.
          Outputs may not be fair, balanced, or appropriate for all situations.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge Cutoffs:</strong> AI models have knowledge cutoffs and cannot access
          real-time information or events after their last training data.</li>
          <li><strong>Computational Errors:</strong> AI can make mathematical errors, logical fallacies,
          or provide inconsistent reasoning.</li>
          <li><strong>Language & Cultural Limitations:</strong> AI may not understand cultural nuances,
          slang, idioms, or context-specific references correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) Model Providers & Routing</h2>
        <p>
          InsightFlowAI may route requests to one or more third‚Äëparty model providers to maintain
          availability and quality (e.g., LongCat AI and other OpenAI‚Äëcompatible providers). Provider
          selection can change over time. You agree that your prompts and necessary context may be sent
          to these providers for processing in accordance with their policies.
        </p>

        <h2>7) Hidden Reasoning (‚ÄúThinking‚Äù)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>By default, AI ‚Äúthinking‚Äù or internal reasoning is hidden in the app‚Äôs UI.</li>
          <li>Users may optionally reveal hidden reasoning via a manual ‚ÄúShow thinking‚Äù toggle.</li>
          <li>Hidden reasoning may be verbose, incomplete, or speculative; treat it as draft analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Safety & Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No attempts to generate or distribute harmful, illegal, or abusive content.</li>
          <li>No attempts to exfiltrate secrets, exploit systems, or misrepresent AI outputs as factual.</li>
          <li>No sharing of others‚Äô private information without consent.</li>
          <li>No automated scraping or rate‚Äëabusive usage of AI endpoints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9) Usage Quotas, Rate Limits & Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          AI Features are subject to usage quotas and rate limits based on your subscription plan and
          fair use policies. These limits are necessary to maintain system stability, ensure fair access
          for all users, and manage costs with third-party AI providers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> Your AI usage is monitored in real-time, including the number
          of requests, tokens processed, and computational resources consumed.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan-Based Limits:</strong> Each subscription tier has specific quotas (e.g., monthly
          AI requests, daily limits). Exceeding these limits may result in temporary restrictions or
          additional charges for overage usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> To prevent system abuse and ensure fair access, we implement
          rate limits on AI requests. Excessive rapid requests may be temporarily blocked.</li>
          <li><strong>Overage Notifications:</strong> When you approach or exceed your usage limits, you will
          receive clear notifications such as "‚ö† Heads up, you've used over X% of your monthly quota" or
          similar warnings. These notifications appear in the app interface.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Reset:</strong> Monthly quotas typically reset at the beginning of each billing
          cycle. Daily limits may reset every 24 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Fair Use Policy:</strong> We reserve the right to restrict or suspend access for users
          who consistently exceed reasonable usage patterns or engage in abusive behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Limits:</strong> AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) may impose
          their own rate limits and usage restrictions independent of our quotas.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Restrictions:</strong> During periods of high demand or system maintenance,
          we may temporarily reduce quotas or implement stricter rate limits to maintain service availability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10) Content Ownership & License</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of your prompts and content you submit. You grant InsightFlowAI a
          license to process, store, display, and analyze that content to provide AI Features and
          improve the service. AI outputs may be similar to content generated for others.
        </p>

        <h2>11) User Input Data & Complete Non-Liability</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Critical Notice:</strong> When using AI Features, you must provide input data, prompts,
          and information for the AI to function. This is an unavoidable technical requirement of artificial
          intelligence systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Zero Liability for Your Input:</strong> We are not liable, responsible, or accountable
          for any information, data, content, or material that you choose to include in your AI interactions,
          regardless of its nature, sensitivity, accuracy, or potential consequences.</li>
          <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for all content you submit,
          including personal information, sensitive data, confidential information, or any other material.
          We do not review, moderate, or take responsibility for user inputs.</li>
          <li><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> Your input data is never shared with third parties for
          marketing, advertising, or commercial purposes. However, it may be processed by AI model
          providers as necessary for service functionality.</li>
          <li><strong>Input Data Retention:</strong> Input data may be stored and retained as necessary to
          provide AI services, maintain conversation context, and improve system performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Necessity:</strong> AI systems require user input to generate responses.
          Without your input, no AI interaction can occur. You acknowledge this technical requirement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12) Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          AI Features are intended for users age 18+ or the age of majority in your jurisdiction.
          Do not allow minors to use AI Features unsupervised.
        </p>

        <h2>13) Security</h2>
        <p>
          We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No system is
          perfectly secure; do not submit secrets or credentials in chat.
        </p>

        <h2>14) Changes to AI Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these AI Terms over time. Material changes will be posted at this page with a
